# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements a simple yet effective **Stock Prediction System** using **Linear Regression** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**. It is designed to predict the future stock price of a company based on historical data.

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

- **Linear Regression:** Predicts continuous stock prices based on trends in historical data.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A non-parametric method used for regression, relying on the closest training examples to make predictions.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Used as an evaluation metric to measure prediction accuracy.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Predicts future stock prices using past data
- Compares performance of **Linear Regression** and **KNN**
- Visualization of prediction vs actual prices
- Calculates and displays **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for evaluation

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **pandas**, **numpy** for data preprocessing
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn** for data visualization
- **scikit-learn** for ML modeling
